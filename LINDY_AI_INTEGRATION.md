## How It Works

The Lindy AI analyzer (`lib/services/lindy-analyzer.ts`) uses intelligent analysis to:

1. **Analyze business context** - Category, reviews, website content
2. **Generate personalized content** - Tailored to specific business
3. **Create conversion-focused copy** - Emphasizes ROI and lead generation
4. **Build email sequences** - Professional, strategic follow-up cadence

## Example Output

For "PINQ Staffing LLC" (Employment agency):

**Business Summary:**
"PINQ Staffing LLC is a Employment agency business with 5 positive customer reviews. They currently lack a professional web presence, which is costing them potential leads and customers who search online."

**Email 1 Subject:**
"Your Employment agency business caught my attention, there"

**Email 1 Body:**
"Hi there,

I noticed PINQ Staffing LLC has been serving customers in the Employment agency industry, which really stood out to me.

However, I noticed your website might not be showcasing these strengths as effectively as it could. No professional website presence. This could be costing you valuable leads every day.

How do you feel your current site is performing in terms of generating new business?

Best,
Riley"
