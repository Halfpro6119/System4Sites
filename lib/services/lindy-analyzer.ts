  const personalizedEmail = `Hi ${firstName},

${icebreaker}, which really stood out to me.

However, I noticed your website might not be showcasing these strengths as effectively as it could. ${painPoints.split(',')[0]}. This could be costing you valuable leads every day.

How do you feel your current site is performing in terms of generating new business?

Best,
Riley`;

  // Email 2: NO LINK - ROI and lead tracking
  const subjectFollowUp1 = `The math on ${businessNameClean}'s website, ${firstName}`;
  const followUp1 = `Hi ${firstName},

Your reputation in the ${category.toLowerCase()} space is clearly strong based on your reviews. But here's the reality: most business websites only convert 2-3% of visitors into leads.

With some strategic improvements, you could be closer to 6-8%. If you're getting even 500 monthly visitors, that's the difference between 10 leads and 40 leads per month.

Do you currently track how many leads your website brings in each month?

Best,
Riley`;

  // Email 3: Include demo link
  const subjectFollowUp2 = `I built something for ${businessNameClean}, ${firstName}`;
  const followUp2 = `Hi ${firstName},

I went ahead and created a demo version of your site to show you what's possible:
ðŸ‘‰ ${demoUrl}

It focuses on three key improvements:
â€¢ Highlighting your reviews and credibility immediately
â€¢ Clear, prominent calls-to-action for inquiries
â€¢ A faster, mobile-friendly layout that works on all devices

Take a quick look â€” it's built specifically with ${businessNameClean} in mind.

Best,
Riley`;

  // Email 4: Include demo link with urgency
  const subjectFollowUp3 = `Did you see the demo, ${firstName}?`;
  const followUp3 = `Hi ${firstName},

Just checking back in â€” your demo site is still live here:
ðŸ‘‰ ${demoUrl}

${icebreaker}. The demo brings this front and center where potential customers can see it immediately, building trust from the first second they land on your site.

Did you get a chance to check it out?

Best,
Riley`;

  // Email 5: Include demo link with specific benefit
  const subjectFollowUp4 = `Your demo won't stay up forever, ${firstName}`;
  const followUp4 = `Hi ${firstName},

Quick note â€” your custom demo site is still online, but I can't promise it will stay live indefinitely.

Here's the link again:
ðŸ‘‰ ${demoUrl}

One of the most impactful changes is moving your reviews and contact information above the fold. This means customers instantly see your credibility and can reach out without scrolling â€” a game-changer for conversion rates.

Best,
Riley`;

  // Email 6: Include demo link - final respectful close
  const subjectFollowUp5 = `Last note about your site, ${firstName}`;
  const followUp5 = `Hi ${firstName},

I'll keep this brief â€” ${businessNameClean} clearly has the experience and reputation to win more business. The only gap is that your current website doesn't showcase it as effectively as it could.

If you're curious, here's the demo one last time:
ðŸ‘‰ ${demoUrl}

If now's not the right time, no problem at all. Just wanted to make sure you had the opportunity to see what's possible.

Best,
Riley`;
